## MARKETING, PR, COMMUNICATIONS, GROWTH, AND YOUR BRAND
High-growth companies' perception of marketing and public relations has shifted over the last 20 years. Product management used to be considered a subset of marketing at many companies in the 1980s and 1990s, while growth marketing did not exist. Public relations used to be about writing press releases.
Things have changed, but the one thing that hasn't: all marketing and PR efforts ultimately contribute to building the company's brand, public perception, and customer acquisition.
