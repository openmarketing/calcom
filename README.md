**Replace listing projects with answering what type of projects to focus on -** Listing projects would limit me to a local optimum, I'd rather craft a plan that answers what kind of marketing should be the focus: product marketing, sales marketing, social and content creation, or more (see [marketing specializations](https://github.com/openmarketing/calcom/blob/main/marketing-types)) from _Elad Gil's High Growth Handbook_).

**Explore going all-in on Enterprise -** The Enterprise product brings more growth predictability than the Infrastructure one to unlock series B, which I assume is the next goal unless Infrastructure already has traction and/or your board is unusually long-term focused, so intentionally excluded the Stripe like product marketing playbook from this exercise. I'll check the data on day 1.

**Replace onboarding on internal docs by running projects with deliverables -** reading docs is usually inefficient. Getting reviews on deliverables will align us faster. For example, instead of "studying users", I'll interview some to create case studies.

## Week 1

- Get set up.

- Open a PR on the internal docs repo to create the user base documentation - aka docs that **answer ‚Äúwho is our target‚Äù (ICP), and ‚Äúhow do we reach them‚Äù (Channel)**.

- Start with defining the ICP through writing case studies, so **schedule user interviews of paying users, focusing on why they converted**.
- **Segment customer** across personas using Demand Curve's structure.

## Week 2-3

- Continue user interviews.

- To get onboarded on the competition, **create dedicated comparison landing pages** ([like this](https://www.hubspot.com/comparisons/pipedrive-vs-hubspot)), for all competitors with an ARR greater than cal.com‚Äôs.

- Run [GV‚Äôs 3 hour brand sprint](https://library.gv.com/the-three-hour-brand-sprint-3ccabf4b768a) to ensure the brand matches the Enterprise focus.

## Week 4

- Fly to meet the founders and the sales lead for a week to accelerate reviews and onboarding.

- **Publish two customer case studies**.

- Depending on how clear the ICP is, consider running Superhuman's product market fit experiment using [this article](https://review.firstround.com/how-superhuman-built-an-engine-to-find-product-market-fit) and [this one](https://coda.io/@rahulvohra/superhuman-product-market-fit-engine).

## Week 5

- **Refocus on channel prioritization**, aka ‚Äúhow do we reach our ICP‚Äù.
  - First, start with running a **Growth marketing retrospective**
    - What worked
    - What didn‚Äôt work
    - What seems to be most promising¬†
  - This requires diving into all the tooling to get all the stats, chat with whoever ran what kind of experiments, etc: face-to-face is ideal.

- **Define my role** - should we focus my role on
  - conversion, aka more growth or/and product marketing,
  - or on sales marketing?
  - All the above will help answer this. Looking at the number of users on cal.com/open, my hunch is we'll end up with layering sales motion on product-led growth, aka with me doing all three. **This would make increasing conversion key, which I've done extensively at Uber (+30% increase in driver sign up) and Amex (leading projects that increased the merchant activation rate by +20% while increasing NPS by 13) .** 

- Sanity check our focus and my associated focus by **interviewing VP Sales from my and the founders‚Äô network**. 

## Week 6

- Agree on the channel prioritization and **scope first experiments** accordingly.

- **Double down on open source by packaging the entire internal docs as a product.** Open source, open heart, open mind,... open docs! From now on, open source all our docs, from how we do marketing to onsites. See [PostHog example](https://posthog.com/handbook/growth/marketing).

## Summary
After 6 weeks, we'll have:
- Two customer case studies
- Open source docs defining our ICP
- Landing pages comparing cal.com to key competitors
- The draft scope of a rebranding, if needed
- Clarity on what channels to start focusing on
- A backlog of experiments to run
- Clarity on my role's focus
- A list of possible VP Sales hires
